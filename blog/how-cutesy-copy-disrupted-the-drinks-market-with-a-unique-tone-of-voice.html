          <p>
            I discovered Innocent smoothies as a student in my early 20s. On my
            lunch break from my temp job, I remember holding an Innocent
            smoothie in my hand while laughing at the frankly surreal copy on
            the label.
          </p>
          <p>
            The ingredients list read: “Approximately half a banana and 3 and a
            1/2 grapes”. The tone felt cheerful and a bit cheeky. I loved that
            they suggested calling them on “the banana phone” (a generational
            in-joke for anyone who is not an 80s child).
          </p>
          <p>
            An impression was made. I was doing a writing and media degree at
            the time, and informality captivated me anyway. That year there may,
            or may not have been, an enthusiastic case study of Terry Deary’s
            Horrible Histories series in my publishing class.
          </p>
          <p>
            Of course, after this discovery, I wanted to work for this fun
            drinks business. But I quickly gave up those lofty pretensions to
            become a life long customer instead.
          </p>
          <h3>Copy with zero pretension</h3>
          <p>
            innocent drinks logo with a small 'i'. It has a playful tone of
            voice. What was attractive about their tone of voice was its
            conversational but straightforward feeling. It was a far cry from
            the pretentious copy you’d find on ‘health food’ packaging at the
            time. It also read like it knew it was breaking conventions. Like a
            young person speaking out of turn in a room full of stuffy old
            people. This appealed to me, and others it seems. What is marketing
            if it doesn’t know how to speak to its audience in their language?
          </p>
          <p>
            Even down to the branding choice of using a lowercase ‘i’ in the
            name. Journalist Eva Wiseman – an Innocent critic, and very much not
            a fan – points out that this is to appear as though they are not
            aligned with big corporate culture. Which is ironic now, because
            since 2009 they’ve been owned by CocaCola. But she’s correct about
            that branding decision at the time, and there was something about
            this that spoke to the wider context of what was happening in the
            food industry.
          </p>
          <h3>
            It was the right time for a new product, and a fresh tone of voice
          </h3>
          <p>
            Innocent made an impression because of the way the market was at the
            time. Different food scandals have dominated each decade of the 20th
            and 21st centuries, and to be fair, they still do. Some may even put
            Innocent on the list of things to be wary of (fruit doesn’t mean low
            sugar after all).
          </p>
          <p>
            But at that time, we’d been through Ribena in the 80s, and then
            Sunny D in the 90s. The public had been naïve and were paying more
            attention to the ingredients list on their foods. Too many brands
            had given the impression that their products were healthy. Innocent
            seemed like a breath of fresh air. Transparent. And its copy choices
            affirmed that.
          </p>
          <p>
            They were market disruptors. A great product, and a strong point of
            view. They grew quickly.
          </p>
          <p>
            What followed was an explosion of smoothies and yoghurt drinks from
            competitors offering similar products at competitive prices.
            Everyone wanted to capitalise on this ‘new’ idea. Drinks started
            innovating to emphasise the purity of their ingredients. And whilst
            Innocent have never claimed to be organic, they are vocal about
            avoiding suppliers who use the most potent pesticides.
          </p>

          <h3>All the elements aligned and the industry was forever altered</h3>
          <p>
            Innocent’s growth in the early noughties coincided with the wider
            changing landscape. In 2004, Super Size Me was released. The
            documentary was an extreme take on the fast food diet, but it still
            raised important questions about the role that fast food
            corporations play in rising obesity rates. It asked whether they are
            as responsible and accountable as they could be. For the first time,
            being ‘anti-McDonalds’ was no longer the realm of a May day
            protester. It’s no wonder brands like Innocent grew.
          </p>
          <p>
            Innocent was thriving in a time of scepticism to mass produced, low
            quality foods. Underpinning it all, they had employed a tone of
            voice and brand personality so potent that it had reverberating
            effects on the market at large for a couple of decades, beyond even
            the drinks industry.
          </p>
          <p>
            It simply changed the field of advertising copy. Award winning
            copywriter Paul Burke, originator of the brand voice, said he lived
            to regret this. You can read his “confession” in The Spectator, but
            in summary, he came up with the concept while working at an ad
            agency alongside one of Innocent’s founders. When the concept was
            finished, he was proud of what he’d done, a straightforward tone of
            voice for a nice honest product. Innocent launched and the brand was
            taken in-house to live on under their own copywriting team.
          </p>
          <h3>Frankenstein is born</h3>
          <p>
            Cookies with a playful tone of voice - eat me is written on them in
            icing. Over time, Burke saw his idea grow beyond his intentions:
            “…Pride turned to horror as Innocent ‘developed’ my innovation…” he
            said. “I remember physically recoiling when, on the base of one
            Innocent carton, it said ‘Stop looking at my bottom’. No, no, no! It
            wasn’t supposed to be like this.”
          </p>
          <p>
            A similar message now sits at the footer if their website, and I
            have to say, it elicited a laugh from me.
          </p>
          <p>
            “British food packaging now has a matey, at worst babyish, tone …”
            Sophie Grimshaw lamented in her 2014 article in The Guardian. “My
            basket of groceries now addresses me as though we are killing time
            on Facebook. I began to wonder when we arrived at this cringey
            consensus, and why.”
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘Wackaging’ (wacky packaging) has been in full throttle since
            Innocent came on the scene. It seemed every new company was asking
            for ‘an Innocent’ treatment from their brand consultants. New, but
            similar, tones of voice were being created to charm buyers in the
            same way. It has lasted for two decades.
          </p>
          <p>
            Its tentacles even seemingly reached broadcasting. Paul Burke noted:
            “When I went on The Moral Maze on Radio 4, and professional trendy
            vicar Giles Fraser addressed me as ‘mate’, I thought I’ve only got
            myself to blame.” It’s disheartening to hear this from the creator
            of a clever concept. Sadly, it’s not unusual when creatives
            relinquish their work to live on in the hands of a corporation.
          </p>
          <h3>The question is, is it that bad?</h3>
          <p>
            Nick Asbury explores the wackaging phenomena in more detail in his
            blog here. His commenters make some valid points, like, is it
            Innocent’s fault that they were so widely copied? It’s just a victim
            of its own success. It’s hard for me to turn on Innocent for that.
          </p>

          <p>
            My thoughts on Paul Burke’s concept haven’t changed. It was an
            original approach. I even think it was inevitable. On speaking to
            The Guardian, Innocent’s in-house copywriter Lucie Bright said they
            were always just using the language they use to talk to their
            friends, and that the cultural shift can only be a good thing. I
            can’t help but agree. Especially considering my first interaction
            with the brand. Our culture was changing, becoming less formal. That
            social shift was always going to be reflected in how businesses
            communicate to their buyers. The fact that a throng of companies
            followed Innocent to the point of banality is a testament to its
            infectious originality.
          </p>
          <p>
            To me, there’s a contrast between how the general public respond to
            brands using this tone of voice, and how industry insiders feel
            about it. For as much as the brand’s voice may have evolved slightly
            from Burke’s original concept, the informality worked.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Who wants to be friends with a banana smoothie?” was Eva Wiseman’s
            question. But why anything in marketing? We could agree that this
            brand voice raises questions of a culture that infantilizes the
            consumer. It’s a worthy criticism. But Innocent didn’t actually do
            that, some its copycats did. And the style seems to have reflected
            the public’s tastes.
          </p>
          <p>
            No brand ever made me laugh like Innocent did. I still read the
            bottles and cartons to see what’s new. The fact that critics
            pinpoint Innocent as the main culprit for wackaging really shows how
            prolific they’ve been. People are still talking about it after more
            than 20 years.
          </p>

          <p>Isn’t that good marketing?</p>
