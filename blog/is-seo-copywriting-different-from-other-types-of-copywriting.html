                <p>
                    Last year a web development agency approached me for some SEO copywriting. Their client wanted to
                    rank
                    locally for a specific search term, but the writers they knew were reluctant to work with SEO
                    software.
                    I
                    got the impression that the copywriters in question were print media specialists. It reminded me of
                    the
                    writers I’d overheard through the years. Those from more traditional settings. Marketing copy gets a
                    bad
                    rep
                    for being low-brow anyway, but SEO seems to have suffered even more. That’s because to be
                    discoverable,
                    writers are having to increasingly embrace the skill, even beyond the marketing scene.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are two problems I see commonly on the SEO issue. The first is that for creatives, the
                    practice
                    seems
                    inhibitive and far removed from ‘the art of writing’. The second problem: there are many non-writers
                    (like
                    business owners) who appreciate the SEO mechanism. But they can be guilty of prizing it over the
                    actual
                    skill of
                    writing. The reality is that to get the best results, we need to understand that one doesn’t exist
                    without
                    the
                    other.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To be fair, SEO copywriting got a bad rep in the early days of its development. That’s because there
                    was,
                    and
                    still is, so much awful content online. Meaningless articles stuffed with keywords, purely written
                    to
                    increase
                    traffic. Many, sadly, still aren’t written with the reader’s needs in mind, or what they’ll feel
                    when
                    they
                    consume the content. I’m haunted by some of the content that I’ve read on well-meaning websites that
                    just
                    wanted
                    to have ‘something’ published. It’s a betrayal to potential customers though. It’s naïve to feed
                    them
                    garbage
                    and expect them to bond with a business.
                </p>

                <h3>Google ranks good content</h3>
                Books in a library
                <p>It’s for that reason that Google increasingly invests in its tech to reach its primary goal “to
                    organise
                    the
                    world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful.” One of the ways they can be
                    confident in
                    serving the best material is to use the data they capture on how readers interact with your content.
                    If
                    readers
                    hit your site and quickly leave (or ‘bounce’), it means they don’t see what they need. Google uses
                    this
                    data
                    as
                    a measurement tool. They know that users are the best judge when it comes to content. In the search
                    process,
                    users are far too busy to consume things that aren’t useful or well-written.
                </p>
                <p>

                    So while SEO is about meeting a number of factors, the principles increasingly based on the practice
                    of
                    good
                    writing.
                </p>


                <h3>How is SEO copywriting different to other types of copy?</h3>
                <p>Copywriting has a long history, and has had an association with advertising since the 1400s when the
                    first
                    newspapers were printed. However as marketing practices get more advanced, we’re seeing a
                    diversification in
                    the
                    types of writing that exist.
                </p>
                <p>

                    <b>Copywriting:</b> Broadly speaking, copywriting continues to be associated with sales. This covers
                    things like
                    advert
                    text, landing pages, product descriptions, category descriptions, and even general website copy.
                </p>
                <p>

                    <b>Content writing:</b> We now also have content writers. Although still a marketing practice that
                    sits
                    within the
                    sales chain, it specifically deals with relationship building. That is to either capture people
                    during
                    the
                    research part of the buying journey, or to build on relationships with existing audiences (either
                    customers
                    or
                    those who are engaged somehow). This covers things like blogs and articles (which are indeed two
                    different
                    types
                    of media, a blog for another time perhaps), white papers, social media content, as well as website
                    content
                    like
                    ‘about’ pages.
                </p>
                <p>

                    In both areas, you can get writers that specialise in these particular fields, and who further niche
                    down
                    into
                    specific industries.
                </p>


                <h3>Most web content is SEO writing</h3>
                <p>Not every part of our content needs to be optimised, even Yoast says this. But when you think about
                    it,
                    which
                    areas of the above wouldn’t benefit from optimisation?
                </p>
                <p>

                    SEO content writing, and SEO copywriting is simply the practice of ensuring that each piece of
                    writing
                    produced
                    fits into your SEO strategy. That is to say that it’s:
                </p>

                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            Written well
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Written with a true purpose (what is it for and who should it reach?)
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            And that the keywords or phrases used both help you to be discovered, and add value to your
                            overall
                            aims.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                <p>

                    Every time you produce something, you need to ask yourself where it fits into your strategy.
                </p>
                <p>

                    Other questions to ask:

                    How else can you get mileage from it? (ie, can this be repurposed for anything else?)
                    What are the mechanisms behind ensuring this content meets the appropriate people?
                    That’s why almost all copywriting that lives online is essentially SEO copywriting. Even press
                    releases
                    and
                    statements – PR related things – could be optimised to maximise their organic search potential.
                </p>


                <h3>Even news agencies recognise the power of SEO</h3>
                <p>Bloomberg news page on a mobile phone
                    It might be surprising to hear that big media groups with their already huge and engaged audiences
                    still
                    have
                    search intent in mind. That’s because they still need to meet readers organically online. SEO expert
                    Dan
                    Smullen
                    says that to do this, he doesn’t even bother to talk about Yoast or SEO with his journalist
                    colleagues,
                    as
                    they’d quickly tune out.
                </p>
                <p>

                    Instead, he promotes the journalistic rules of ‘the five w’s to help them reach their SEO KPIs.
                    Those
                    are:
                    who,
                    what, when, where, and why (I’m going to throw in the ‘h’ there also: ‘how’). Those elements make up
                    the
                    keywords of the headline, along with any additional copy to pique reader interest. It’s so simple,
                    but
                    effective.
                </p>


                <h3>Some online media is not for everyone’s eyes</h3>
                <p>Smullen also makes a differentiation between online news and print news: “In print, you can
                    immediately
                    take
                    in
                    all that is around the headline, all the pictures, subheads… Search engines also don’t understand
                    puns
                    or
                    the
                    witty headline. They understand keywords.”
                </p>
                <p>

                    Now that’s a crucial point, because in print copy, there are other factors that are important –
                    layout,
                    headlines, images, how the entirety of the page looks. Print media pulls the eye around the page in
                    a
                    different
                    way to how someone consumes media when they are scrolling or searching.
                </p>
                <p>

                    But some online media lives outside of the realms of search. Below are a few examples of digital
                    copy
                    where
                    SEO
                    isn’t a factor:
                </p>
                <p>

                    Landing pages for specific campaigns: You’ve nurtured an audience on a particular platform like
                    Facebook
                    or
                    LinkedIn. You’ve niched this paid marketing campaign to them. Your final destination in the funnel
                    is a
                    landing
                    page, targeted only to people who you’ve built a relationship with (ie, they’ve seen or interacted
                    with
                    previous
                    adverts of yours, and this is the last stage in the funnel). Your landing page is offering something
                    exclusive
                    for these eyes only.
                    Email marketing copy: This is usually to an engaged audience who’ve signed up to receieve
                    information
                    from
                    you.
                    Of course it’s hitting mail boxes, so you don’t need to be optimising here as there’s no search
                    capacity
                    for
                    this copy.
                </p>
                <p>

                    Exclusive copy: subscriber-only material: There are times when you really are writing for
                    member-only
                    crowds.
                    This could be exclusive content, things really only your niche subscribed audience need to know
                    (like, a
                    members
                    only special offer, an event, or even the new director in your company).
                </p>
                <p>

                    The above elements may live online but it’s almost like print material. Because although it’s still
                    on
                    screen,
                    it’s not content with any search potential. Where this differs from SEO content is that there’s room
                    to
                    be
                    witty
                    and playful with headlines. Remember Smullen’s point that search engines understand keywords, not
                    wit –
                    well
                    here is where we have an overlap with traditional print, allowing the copywriter to have more fun.
                </p>


                <h3>Intelligence on search intent does intersect with non-SEO content</h3>
                <p>Even where we’re not optimising copy for actual key terms, intelligence in search intent is
                    important. If
                    you
                    know what your market is looking for, it’s an opportunity to provide them with something useful.
                    Using
                    key
                    terms
                    in headlines for those non-SEO materials can help users quickly see what you can do for them. That’s
                    particularly important in something like an advert, where people are scrolling. In such cases, you
                    only
                    have
                    a
                    few seconds to get their interest. So bear that in mind.

                <h3>SEO doesn’t stop at one page, it’s an ongoing process</h3>
                <p>Non-marketers sometimes need a steer on what to expect from SEO, and how it works. For the most part,
                    SEO
                    is
                    actually about good writing. But what it’s certainly not is optimising a single product page or a
                    blog
                    for a
                    page one result. It’s also not something that happens overnight. And it isn’t just keywords or
                    phrases.
                    It’s
                    not
                    limited to the green lights on Yoast.
                </p>
                <p>

                    It requires research, planning and implementation. This process should have your business objectives
                    in
                    mind.
                    You implement what you’ve learned from the last phase into each new stage. This helps you to build
                    up
                    your
                    communications effectively for an organic search, and get that much desired authority with Google.
                    It’s
                    earned
                    over time, and it’s a continuous process.
                </p>
                <p>

                    As Google prioritises user behaviour, us copywriters are happy that SEO is as much about delivering
                    excellent
                    penmanship. Those skills can be learned, but you can’t ignore them just because you installed Yoast
                    on
                    your
                    website. Your copy needs to engage, entertain, persuade, inform, and convert. That’s all those good
                    things
                    that
                    you need an experienced writer for.
                </p>
                <p>

                    What’s the use in a great search result if the copy doesn’t do its job at the end? Readers need to
                    be
                    captivated. SEO is the mechanism that delivers your content to the right eyes. Once they see it, the
                    writing
                    has
                    it’s own work to do – it’s got to win hearts.
                </p>
                <h3>

                    The balance of art and tech: SEO copywriting assimilates both, one can’t exist without the other
                </h3>
                <p>

                    Lots of creatives into marketing because they love their art and can exploit their talent in an
                    industry
                    that
                    needs it. But when the art hits the cross-section of technology, it can somehow appear reductive of
                    their
                    skill.
                    But all the high-quality content we consume online is optimised. I’m not saying SEO is an infallible
                    system,
                    but
                    it’s here and we have to work with it. We shouldn’t be afraid of it.
                </p>
                <p>

                    “Yoast is pedantic” is the best line I have ever read about the software. It is! And it’s hard
                    enough
                    with
                    an
                    editor, but at least you can talk to an editor, right? But we should remember that Yoast is a tool,
                    not
                    a
                    writing software. It’s especially useful to quickly ensure that our writing meets all the
                    requirements
                    that
                    will
                    help it be found. We can focus on the art. Yoast assists us with some technical aspects that can
                    suffer
                    in
                    the
                    writing process.

                    To draw a comparison, my favourite thing about the five w’s is that Aristotle came up with them in
                    Nicomachean
                    Ethics, his most well-known work. The repurposing of these ancient principles are fascinating to me,
                    showing
                    how
                    ancient concepts continue to live on in our modern lives. How they can even underpin our current
                    technological
                    situation.
                </p>
                <p>

                    It makes me wonder if technology ever really replaces the fundamental things that humans want to do.
                    Perhaps
                    it
                    merely helps us to do those things with more ease? That’s also something to think about when SEO is
                    concerned.
