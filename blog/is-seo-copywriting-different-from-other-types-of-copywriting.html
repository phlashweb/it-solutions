            <p>
              Last year a web development agency approached me for some SEO copywriting. Their client wanted to
              rank
              locally for a specific search term, but the writers they knew were reluctant to work with SEO
              software.
              I
              got the impression that the copywriters in question were print media specialists. It reminded me of
              the
              writers I’d overheard through the years. Those from more traditional settings. Marketing copy gets a
              bad
              rep
              for being low-brow anyway, but SEO seems to have suffered even more. That’s because to be
              discoverable,
              writers are having to increasingly embrace the skill, even beyond the marketing scene.
            </p>
            <p>
              There are two problems I see commonly on the SEO issue. The first is that for creatives, the
              practice
              seems
              inhibitive and far removed from ‘the art of writing’. The second problem: there are many non-writers
              (like
              business owners) who appreciate the SEO mechanism. But they can be guilty of prizing it over the
              actual
              skill of
              writing. The reality is that to get the best results, we need to understand that one doesn’t exist
              without
              the
              other.
            </p>
            <p>
              To be fair, SEO copywriting got a bad rep in the early days of its development. That’s because there
              was,
              and
              still is, so much awful content online. Meaningless articles stuffed with keywords, purely written
              to
              increase
              traffic. Many, sadly, still aren’t written with the reader’s needs in mind, or what they’ll feel
              when
              they
              consume the content. I’m haunted by some of the content that I’ve read on well-meaning websites that
              just
              wanted
              to have ‘something’ published. It’s a betrayal to potential customers though. It’s naïve to feed
              them
              garbage
              and expect them to bond with a business.
            </p>

            <h3>Google ranks good content</h3>
            <img src="../images/blog/books-in-a-library.webp" alt="Books in a library">
            <p>It’s for that reason that Google increasingly invests in its tech to reach its primary goal “to
              organise
              the
              world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful.” One of the ways they can be
              confident in
              serving the best material is to use the data they capture on how readers interact with your content.
              If
              readers
              hit your site and quickly leave (or ‘bounce’), it means they don’t see what they need. Google uses
              this
              data
              as
              a measurement tool. They know that users are the best judge when it comes to content. In the search
              process,
              users are far too busy to consume things that aren’t useful or well-written.
            </p>
            <p>

              So while SEO is about meeting a number of factors, the principles increasingly based on the practice
              of
              good
              writing.
            </p>


            <h3>How is SEO copywriting different to other types of copy?</h3>
            <p>Copywriting has a long history, and has had an association with advertising since the 1400s when the
              first
              newspapers were printed. However as marketing practices get more advanced, we’re seeing a
              diversification in
              the
              types of writing that exist.
            </p>
            <p>

              <b>Copywriting:</b> Broadly speaking, copywriting continues to be associated with sales. This covers
              things like
              advert
              text, landing pages, product descriptions, category descriptions, and even general website copy.
            </p>
            <p>

              <b>Content writing:</b> We now also have content writers. Although still a marketing practice that
              sits
              within the
              sales chain, it specifically deals with relationship building. That is to either capture people
              during
              the
              research part of the buying journey, or to build on relationships with existing audiences (either
              customers
              or
              those who are engaged somehow). This covers things like blogs and articles (which are indeed two
              different
              types
              of media, a blog for another time perhaps), white papers, social media content, as well as website
              content
              like
              ‘about’ pages.
            </p>
            <p>

              In both areas, you can get writers that specialise in these particular fields, and who further niche
              down
              into
              specific industries.
            </p>


            <h3>Most web content is SEO writing</h3>
            <p>Not every part of our content needs to be optimised, even Yoast says this. But when you think about
              it,
              which
              areas of the above wouldn’t benefit from optimisation?
            </p>
            <p>

              SEO content writing, and SEO copywriting is simply the practice of ensuring that each piece of
              writing
              produced
              fits into your SEO strategy. That is to say that it’s:
            </p>

            <ol>
              <li>
                Written well
              </li>
              <li>
                Written with a true purpose (what is it for and who should it reach?)
              </li>
              <li>
                And that the keywords or phrases used both help you to be discovered, and add value to your
                overall
                aims.
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p>

              Every time you produce something, you need to ask yourself where it fits into your strategy.
            </p>
            <p>

              Other questions to ask:

              How else can you get mileage from it? (ie, can this be repurposed for anything else?)
              What are the mechanisms behind ensuring this content meets the appropriate people?
              That’s why almost all copywriting that lives online is essentially SEO copywriting. Even press
              releases
              and
              statements – PR related things – could be optimised to maximise their organic search potential.
            </p>


            <h3>Even news agencies recognise the power of SEO</h3>
            <img src="../images/blog/bloomberg-news-page-on-a-mobile-phone.webp"
              alt="Bloomberg news page on a mobile phone">
            <p>
              It might be surprising to hear that big media groups with their already huge and engaged audiences
              still
              have
              search intent in mind. That’s because they still need to meet readers organically online. SEO expert
              Dan
              Smullen
              says that to do this, he doesn’t even bother to talk about Yoast or SEO with his journalist
              colleagues,
              as
              they’d quickly tune out.
            </p>
            <p>

              Instead, he promotes the journalistic rules of ‘the five w’s to help them reach their SEO KPIs.
              Those
              are:
              who,
              what, when, where, and why (I’m going to throw in the ‘h’ there also: ‘how’). Those elements make up
              the
              keywords of the headline, along with any additional copy to pique reader interest. It’s so simple,
              but
              effective.
            </p>


            <h3>Some online media is not for everyone’s eyes</h3>
            <p>Smullen also makes a differentiation between online news and print news: “In print, you can
              immediately
              take
              in
              all that is around the headline, all the pictures, subheads… Search engines also don’t understand
              puns
              or
              the
              witty headline. They understand keywords.”
            </p>
            <p>

              Now that’s a crucial point, because in print copy, there are other factors that are important –
              layout,
              headlines, images, how the entirety of the page looks. Print media pulls the eye around the page in
              a
              different
              way to how someone consumes media when they are scrolling or searching.
            </p>
            <p>

              But some online media lives outside of the realms of search. Below are a few examples of digital
              copy
              where
              SEO
              isn’t a factor:
            </p>
            <p>

              Landing pages for specific campaigns: You’ve nurtured an audience on a particular platform like
              Facebook
              or
              LinkedIn. You’ve niched this paid marketing campaign to them. Your final destination in the funnel
              is a
              landing
              page, targeted only to people who you’ve built a relationship with (ie, they’ve seen or interacted
              with
              previous
              adverts of yours, and this is the last stage in the funnel). Your landing page is offering something
              exclusive
              for these eyes only.
              Email marketing copy: This is usually to an engaged audience who’ve signed up to receieve
              information
              from
              you.
              Of course it’s hitting mail boxes, so you don’t need to be optimising here as there’s no search
              capacity
              for
              this copy.
            </p>
            <p>

              Exclusive copy: subscriber-only material: There are times when you really are writing for
              member-only
              crowds.
              This could be exclusive content, things really only your niche subscribed audience need to know
              (like, a
              members
              only special offer, an event, or even the new director in your company).
            </p>
            <p>

              The above elements may live online but it’s almost like print material. Because although it’s still
              on
              screen,
              it’s not content with any search potential. Where this differs from SEO content is that there’s room
              to
              be
              witty
              and playful with headlines. Remember Smullen’s point that search engines understand keywords, not
              wit –
              well
              here is where we have an overlap with traditional print, allowing the copywriter to have more fun.
            </p>


            <h3>Intelligence on search intent does intersect with non-SEO content</h3>
            <p>Even where we’re not optimising copy for actual key terms, intelligence in search intent is
              important. If
              you
              know what your market is looking for, it’s an opportunity to provide them with something useful.
              Using
              key
              terms
              in headlines for those non-SEO materials can help users quickly see what you can do for them. That’s
              particularly important in something like an advert, where people are scrolling. In such cases, you
              only
              have
              a
              few seconds to get their interest. So bear that in mind.
            </p>


            <h3>SEO doesn’t stop at one page, it’s an ongoing process</h3>
            <p>Non-marketers sometimes need a steer on what to expect from SEO, and how it works. For the most part,
              SEO
              is
              actually about good writing. But what it’s certainly not is optimising a single product page or a
              blog
              for a
              page one result. It’s also not something that happens overnight. And it isn’t just keywords or
              phrases.
              It’s
              not
              limited to the green lights on Yoast.
            </p>
            <p>

              It requires research, planning and implementation. This process should have your business objectives
              in
              mind.
              You implement what you’ve learned from the last phase into each new stage. This helps you to build
              up
              your
              communications effectively for an organic search, and get that much desired authority with Google.
              It’s
              earned
              over time, and it’s a continuous process.
            </p>
            <p>

              As Google prioritises user behaviour, us copywriters are happy that SEO is as much about delivering
              excellent
              penmanship. Those skills can be learned, but you can’t ignore them just because you installed Yoast
              on
              your
              website. Your copy needs to engage, entertain, persuade, inform, and convert. That’s all those good
              things
              that
              you need an experienced writer for.
            </p>
            <p>

              What’s the use in a great search result if the copy doesn’t do its job at the end? Readers need to
              be
              captivated. SEO is the mechanism that delivers your content to the right eyes. Once they see it, the
              writing
              has
              it’s own work to do – it’s got to win hearts.
            </p>
            <h3>

              The balance of art and tech: SEO copywriting assimilates both, one can’t exist without the other
            </h3>
            <p>

              Lots of creatives into marketing because they love their art and can exploit their talent in an
              industry
              that
              needs it. But when the art hits the cross-section of technology, it can somehow appear reductive of
              their
              skill.
              But all the high-quality content we consume online is optimised. I’m not saying SEO is an infallible
              system,
              but
              it’s here and we have to work with it. We shouldn’t be afraid of it.
            </p>
            <p>

              “Yoast is pedantic” is the best line I have ever read about the software. It is! And it’s hard
              enough
              with
              an
              editor, but at least you can talk to an editor, right? But we should remember that Yoast is a tool,
              not
              a
              writing software. It’s especially useful to quickly ensure that our writing meets all the
              requirements
              that
              will
              help it be found. We can focus on the art. Yoast assists us with some technical aspects that can
              suffer
              in
              the
              writing process.
            </p>
            <p>

              To draw a comparison, my favourite thing about the five w’s is that Aristotle came up with them in
              Nicomachean
              Ethics, his most well-known work. The repurposing of these ancient principles are fascinating to me,
              showing
              how
              ancient concepts continue to live on in our modern lives. How they can even underpin our current
              technological
              situation.
            </p>
            <p>

              It makes me wonder if technology ever really replaces the fundamental things that humans want to do.
              Perhaps
              it
              merely helps us to do those things with more ease? That’s also something to think about when SEO is
              concerned.
