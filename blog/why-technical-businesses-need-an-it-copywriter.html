                    <div class="article-content">

                        <p>
                            While at a business exhibition, a business owner once remarked to me that that from reading
                            some of the exhibitors’ display banners, it looked like their businesses did the same thing.
                            It was only by talking to the representatives that they realised their first impression
                            wasn’t true at all. Looking around the room, I could see what they meant. This was a person
                            with a technical background. And what they really meant was the generic statements plastered
                            everywhere.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            That got me thinking. Imagine what navigating the internet is like if you don’t even have a
                            technical background. How many people call the wrong business looking for the wrong thing?
                            And imagine the time saved for all by clients being able to quickly identify the right
                            service.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Technical businesses need copywriters more than anyone</h3>
                        <p>Copywriting in the technical space is about balancing the service offered with a multitude of
                            other components. Making it clear what problems you solve, while giving an understanding of
                            what the client can expect from you. This should be wrapped up in the right tone of voice
                            for your market and giving some brand personality (because in the interaction you want your
                            reader to feel something).
                        </p>
                        <p>But some businesses still do not do this.
                        </p>
                        <p>That’s why getting a copywriter on board for any business communications is a good idea. Not
                            only does it allow you to focus on the running of your company, but it means you are in the
                            hands of a professional who will connect you to your target audience. It’s going to be a
                            much more efficient and successful outcome that way.
                        </p>
                        <p>So if you’re a business of a technical nature, a technical or IT copywriter could be the
                            essential component to bridging the gap between what you offer and how the client
                            understands your service. How? Read on.
                        </p>




                        <h3>Clients don’t always know what they need: An IT copywriter can help</h3>
                        <p>An IT copywriter can help a prospective client to see their problems reflected in your
                            service pages, and easily understand how you can help. They’ll bridge the barrier between
                            ‘normal’ folk and the technical teams delivering the service. In this process, a copywriter
                            can often focus on building a relationship by reducing guilt on the part of the consumer,
                            and raising relatability instead. These problems are normal, and human, and not everyone can
                            be expected to understand the dense stuff.
                        </p>
                        <p>A common pain point for all companies, let alone those of a tech nature, is that clients
                            don’t always understand what they want. Or even what they are asking for. Let alone how much
                            value to put on it. And even if they do, often they can’t tell if it’s you they need to
                            solve their problem.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Of course we live in a time where we have educated markets. However an IT copywriter will be
                            able to write material for multiple niches, ensuring it’s easy on any market level,
                            balancing the offer with a message that will make an impression.
                        </p>
                        <h3>A copywriter will challenge your internal language</h3>
                        <p>
                            There are accepted industry terms that customers will expect to see on your website. But
                            when clients are confused by what you do, it’s usually the result of ‘in-speak’. Websites
                            are often written from the perspective of an internal team, even when they have a copywriter
                            at their disposal. And whilst you may have gifted in-house writers who understand what you
                            have to offer very well, it could be that the copy just isn’t written from a
                            user-perspective.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If that’s the case, it’s common that the needs of your target client are being neglected.
                            Their problems must be represented, their questions answered, and an appropriate amount of
                            education to the audience should be given.
                        </p>
                        <h3>How clients become confused</h3>
                        <p>Let’s take IT support. Broadly speaking, there are two types of IT support – hardware and
                            software. In the same vein, there are also two different types
                            of markets – business to business, or business to customer.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The business to customer market is going to require less industry terms and more everyday
                            language for the average user. This will allow them to identify very quickly if you can help
                            them before contacting you. If you are going for a domestic market, do they even know the
                            difference between hardware and software?
                        </p>
                        <h3>Keep it simple</h3>

                            There’s a case for taking a simple approach regardless of what business you’re in. Even on a
                            B2B level, it can often be that your ideal client will not be as technical as you. If they
                            are outsourcing support, it’s likely they don’t have the in-house specialism that they
                            require. And apart from that, imagine the amount of these businesses where it’s the business
                            owners themselves doing the primary research, which will definitely be the case with
                            independent companies, and smaller businesses. Imagine also those asking their PA or HR
                            personnel to research support services.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            An IT copywriter will help you explore who your market is and prioritise the appropriate
                            problems that you solve with the right storytelling and language. They can communicate
                            meaning simply, without being boring or abstract, allowing your audience to quickly and
                            simply understand what they need to know.
                        </p>


                        <h3>Creating an approachable brand</h3>
                        <img src="../images/blog/welcome-sign.jpg" alt="Welcome Sign" />
                        <p>Part of the job of your copy is to give a sense of who you are and what
                            you are like to interact with. The tone of your business copy is a way of establishing the
                            relationship you are going to have with your client, and this is different for everyone and
                            depends on how formal your style of service is.
                        </p>
                        <p>However, a big concern of those in technical services are being approachable and easy to
                            understand. Communicating a sense of personality, or a friendly voice could be a good
                            approach when dealing with dense subjects. That’s because technology can be an intimidating
                            area for clients if your ideal customers are those who have no knowledge of your service.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This plays out in businesses like website hosting firms where small business owners with no
                            IT teams have to deal directly with the solution provider themselves. So in these cases,
                            it’s essential to demystify the apparent black magic of technology, and language is a big
                            part of that.
                        </p>
                        <p>Creating copy that doesn’t intimidate your market while still doing the work of communicating
                            your expertise and value is something the best copywriters find easy. Taking this approach
                            will help you to reach markets inhabited by non-technical folk.
                        </p>

                        <h3>
                            An IT copywriter will prepare your audience
                        </h3>
                        <p>
                            Sometimes clients need to understand a few things before they contact you. A copywriter will
                            help you to solve any existing problems you’re experiencing with some thoughtful messaging.
                            This could help you in a few ways.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Education</h3>
                        <p>
                            For less aware markets, an IT copywriter will be able to help your clients understand how
                            your solution solves their problems. That’s an education in itself. More than that, though,
                            they may discuss with you ideas for specific content (blogs, or social media posts etc) that
                            help answer your client’s questions in or around your jurisdiction. These could help build
                            your authority in your field. Not just as service providers, but as experts.
                        </p>
                        <h3>What to expect from your service</h3>
                        <p>Clients need their expectations set up appropriately. Maybe you are a bespoke service, or you
                            have a tiered service depending on the subscription they sign up for. Will they deal with
                            humans, or do they access your service via an online account? These are things your IT
                            copywriter will consider and help build your audience’s expectations so they understand the
                            terms on which you deliver your solution and play up the benefits of your service in the
                            best way.</p>
                        <h3>Content for the researcher – capturing your market at the ‘pre-buy’ stage</h3>
                        <p>Copywriting is about selling, content writing is about building trust. A writer niched in IT
                            and technology can help you attract audiences at different stages of the buying process. A
                            good writer will see opportunities for you to capture those in the research stage and bring
                            them to your website. With the right search terms, and some excellent pieces that help them
                            answer the questions they have just before they buy a product like yours could mean you’ll
                            win a fan that will get them to the checkout later.</p>
                        <h3>Understanding the depth of work</h3>
                        <p>Clients don’t always understand the tricky work of technical services. Sometimes clients
                            don’t appreciate the work that goes on behind the scenes. Project managers and customer
                            support can shield them from the pain of dealing directly with a developer. What that does
                            is they can underestimate the work that goes into a specific service. While you want your
                            solution to be ‘easy’ for the client, you want to be value with them, and a copywriter can
                            easily help you do this in how they write about your services, striking just the right
                            balance of offering a solution that is easy for them to access, facilitated by your hardwork
                            and expertise in the field.</p>
                        <h3>A copywriter’s skills help you to build a sense of value</h3>
                        <p>Clients don’t always understand why something costs what it does. And if we’re being fair,
                            why should they? It’s the job of the business who are selling the solution to build that
                            sense of value.</p>
                        <p>But it’s not easy. A copywriter is a wordsmith and a salesperson. They bring a fresh
                            perspective to your value and are adept at communicating the benefits of a service in a way
                            that you might not have previously considered.</p>
                        <p>If you find your clients are often surprised, then it’s a good time to look at where your
                            website copy can be improved. If it’s hard to get a sense of perspective, get third party
                            feedback via a user testing service. And don’t forget to check what your competitors are
                            doing. Don’t copy them, but it will be an education on where you can build a better sense of
                            value.</p>
                        <h3>Working with a professional adds credibility</h3>
                        <img src="../images/blog/linkedin-logo.png" alt="Linkedin Logo"/>
                        <p>I am going to take you to a more general point now, outside of the realms of technology.
                            There is an art to creating copy and content that both sells and creates relationships with
                            your target markets. But there’s a good ‘housekeeping’ reason to work with a professional
                            writer. It reduces the chances of mistakes being made in your business copy.</p>
                        <p>That may seem like a minor point, but actually it’s as important as any on this list. Because
                            numerous studies over the years show that poor grammar reduces credibility, and these
                            mistakes cost businesses money.</p>
                        <p>No service is infallible and mistakes do happen. But to consistently jar your reader is
                            dangerous territory. <a

                                target="_blank" rel="noopener">Research from 2013 showed that 74% of readers pay

                            avoid buying from a company with obvious spelling or grammar mistakes.</p>
                        <p>But that was nine years ago, surely we have moved on from this? Perhaps, but not much. <a

                                target="_blank" rel="noopener">conducted a sample survey showing a strong correlation
                                between good writing and promotion</a> into directorships. Taking 100 profiles, they
                            found that those who had failed to make a directorship position in their first ten years of
                            career were 2.5 times more likely to have grammar and spelling errors in their profiles.
                            Candidates with fewer mistakes were more likely to be promoted multiple times in the same
                            ten year period.</p>
                        <h3>What does that have to do with copywriting?</h3>
                        <p>This data is proof of the work culture in which we operate. Those decision-makers who are
                            promoting their directors are also making decisions about what businesses they partner with.

                            want to work with impeccable suppliers.</p>
                        <p>That’s a consideration that can’t be overlooked.</p>
